        "Autoencoders are neural network architectures used for unsupervised learning and are primarily employed for various tasks related to representation learning and dimensionality reduction. Here are some of the main tasks that autoencoders are used for:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) `Data Compression and Dimensionality Reduction` : Autoencoders are often used to compress data and reduce its dimensionality. By learning a compact representation of the input data, autoencoders can capture essential features while discarding less important information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) `Anomaly Detection` : Autoencoders can be used for anomaly detection by training on normal data and then identifying instances that deviate significantly from the learned representation. Anomalies may correspond to outliers or rare events in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) `Noise Reduction` : Autoencoders can be trained to denoise data. By reconstructing clean data from noisy input, autoencoders learn to filter out unwanted variations, making them useful for tasks like image denoising or signal reconstruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) `Feature Learning` : Autoencoders are effective for learning hierarchical representations and features from unlabeled data. The encoder part of the autoencoder learns to extract meaningful features that can be useful for downstream tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) `Image Generation` : Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), a type of autoencoder, are used for generating new samples from the learned distribution. VAEs provide a structured way to generate new, realistic samples by sampling from the learned latent space.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) `Representation Learning` : Autoencoders are powerful for learning compact and informative representations of data. The learned representations can be used as feature vectors for supervised tasks, improving the performance of classifiers and other models.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) `Semantic Hashing` : Autoencoders can be employed for semantic hashing, where high-dimensional data, such as text or images, is mapped to binary codes. These binary codes preserve semantic similarity, making them useful for tasks like efficient retrieval in large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "8) `Natural Language Processing (NLP)` : Autoencoders can be used for learning distributed representations of words or sentences in NLP tasks. By training on a large corpus, they can capture semantic relationships between words and improve the performance of downstream NLP applications."
